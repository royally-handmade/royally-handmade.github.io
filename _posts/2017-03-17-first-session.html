    Arriving in <b>Red Larch</b> after being sent to ensure the safe arrival of a delegation of various VIPs from their respective guilds, our heroes decided to kill time
    until the delegation arrived. They did this by helping around town and generally pestering the villagers.
    The very <b>helpful maid</b> at the local tavern pointed them in the direction of people in need around town and filled them in on the state of the general area.
    <br />Long story short;
    <ul>
        <li>the weather is losing its shit,</li>
        <li>monsters are showing up and because of the generally disagreeable situation that creates,</li>
        <li>the village was kind of on edge.</li>
    </ul>
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> This rumor hunting eventually led them to accuse the local quarry manager of <i>"murder"</i> (repeatedly) and unearthing
    stories of strange figures in stone masks haunting the quarry and scaring off workers by night. A rumor the manager <i>vehemently</i> denied any truth of.
    The heroes then asked the local constable, the only law enforcement in town, what's up and were pointed in the direction of a bandit camp outside of town
    and stories of a "haunted" tomb nearby. Bandits sounded like the perfect things to test how killing actually works. So they went out into the
    dangerous wilds - a few hours walk outside of town.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Upon arriving at the bandits camp unnoticed they had the element of surprise on their side. They then decided to discuss how to best stealthily approach the camp.
    <b>Loudly.</b> Before a plan was made, the party was set upon by bandits. And a bear. Battle commenced and fires were made, songs were sung, glares were had,
    bows hit faces, arrows were named and the group found out that magic missle was quite indeed, bad ass. With victory achieved the heroes decided to head
    back to town to decide the next destination.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Before heading out, however, our heroes figured out that currency can be exchanged for goods and services in this town and decided to stock up on supplies like oil,
    arrows, rope and pickles. Like <b>lots of pickles.</b> Like half an hour of real time talking to a half-orc named Grund who <i>sold</i> them pickles.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> The so-called haunted tomb was next! Spurred on by rumors that the "haunting" might just actually be some goblins, the heroes went in full of confidence and plans to
    show goblins which end of the sword you're not supposed to grip with your hands. Unfortunately for them it was quite haunted by actual ghosts.
    Not even goblin ones. A Spectre and a haunted sword struck against them after the group decided to touch an old door the ghosts were apparently quite partial to.
    There was a near death but in the end arrows were named and chests were looted after spending a few minutes staring at rocks and coming to the conclusion that
    they were indeed in a tomb multiple times. Jubilations abounded as combat became more familiar and the second taste of victory washed over the party.
    Upon attempting to leave the tomb however they stumbled upon a half ogre and an actual goblin, asleep. Their attempt to sneak past them was cut short when the
    Druid stumbled a little and as an immediate reaction, set the pair on fire. In one more brief combat session they felled the half ogre and goblin but not before
    the Barbarian discovered momentary Herculean strength and hurled a javelin with enough force to kill a god. But she missed and the last the party saw it was still
    soaring out into the horizon. The Druid then ended combat with setting even more fire to the duo and her Barbarian friend. This caused the Barbarian to decide
    that this was a great time for an involuntary nap in the dirt. Not the best day for the Barbarian.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> But victory was had! Our heroes headed back to town, dragging their now slightly charred and unconscious Barbarian companion back to town,
    feeling stronger for their efforts and looking forward to the next adventure.
    <i>After a good nap.</i>
