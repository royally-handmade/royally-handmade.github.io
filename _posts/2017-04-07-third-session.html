    <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right fa-2x"></i> After a day of rest from their necromantic cave adventure our heroes lost the barbarian. Rumors abounded about her fate. Perhaps she left to hunt down her favourite spear she sent hurling off into the horizon of went off to hunt down this "fire cult" she was always going on about. Maybe she got lost? Is she alive? Is she off on a grand adventure on her own? Is she dead?!
    <br /><br />
Our heroes (sans barbarian) found themselves in the Swinging Sword Inn enjoying their evening and new found fame. The barmaid, asking the group to call her Lee, asked about their adventures and flirted(?) a bit then went to attend to her duties. A rather inebriated halfling then stumbled up to the party shortly afterward to gush about his love for the party and introduce himself as Stan. Through his ramblings he offered the party a way into a possible hidden entryway in his workplace that he's seen his boss and several other shady characters in cloaks dissapear into at night when they think no one is working. One of which he was even able to identify as the local quarry manager (which the party accused of murder just over a week ago). Offering to meet them on a night of their choosing Stan gushed a little more then stumbled home.
    <br /><br />
Our heroes apparently had a queue or something that evening because they were approached by two more people, one of which they recognized as Grund, the local half orc pickle salesman and an old man going by the name of Dornen who claimed to be Grunds boss of sorts. After Dornen attempting to insult the party he tried to point them in the direction of Tricklerock Cave, a location mentioned to them earlier by others as possibly having treasure with Dornen following it up by saying that heroes should clean up their messes and not leave dangerous things unattended or else bad things could happen to townsfolk emulating them and vaguely mentioning Stan in that remark. Our heroes took offense to this but before they could do anything about it, yet ANOTHER person burst into the busy night at the tavern and demanded the heroes attention.
    <br /><br />
This one didn't directly ask the heroes anything or even talk directly at them, more than he just burst through the front door screaming in agony and confusion. Mangobarl, the local baker and Altrin's thieving guild contact had apparently gone to investigate the rumor of a skull pinned to a tree outside of town that the heroes had let fall by this wayside. The result of which was a black human looking skull that had become permanently fused with Mangobarls hand by covering his hand and part of his wrist with the black crystal rock substance the skull seemed to be made out of. He ranted and raved about an eye watching them and disturbing dreams before quickly passing out in a corner. The heroes and Lee father's around him to see if they could help when he suddenly awoke with black eyes with ribbons of colours flowing through them and purple pupils and spoke in what seemed like a thousand voices saying
"The eye is open. The world tears itself apart for their arrival, so eager for its own destruction. The dead rule the pious amongst stones of worship. The spear of feathers rots but hides a light. A leaf beneath a moon of red hides a spark, preparing to consume all. The river scowls as it guards against itself to keep appearances. A caravan, swallowed by monks. The power this world was not meant to have must be returned. In the end all paths lead to the eye watching from below. What is, must always be. The lights must return that which was stolen or all will tremble and despair, but one is doomed to never die"
    <br /><br />
This rightfully weirded the party out. Lee took him and the party upstairs to decide what to do next. They poked the black rock crystal skull arm and it retaliated by almost singeing Marko's eyebrows off. They decided to not do that again. They almost decided to chop off Mangobarls arm but decided to wait while Marko got suspicious of Lee for being so involved.  In the end they decided to go to Tricklerock Cave to prevent any vague threats to stan.
    <br /><br />
It was a trick, there was no treasure, just furry mosquito nets. The party headed back to town pissed off and decided to storm Dornen office and demand answers. Marko was sick of Dornens shit and shot ice beams at Dornens favourite rocks playing bad cop, bad cop. Altrin stole the rocks. Dornen admitted to tricking them into the cave hoping to be rid of them "for the good of the town" but before much more questioning could take place from outside there arose quite a clatter. And panic. It definitely sounded like panic with a mix of earthquake.
    <br /><br />
A giant sinkhole had had appeared in the middle of town. Altrin quickly fell in but made it seem like he intended that all along by helping some children who had fallen victim to the initial cave in. Tazka then decided to be batman. He grabbed Dornen by the scruff of his coat and dangled him over the pit after hearing Dornen whisper conspiratorial things about the pit. Tazka wanted answers but the local law enforcement Harburk talked tazka down after tazka remembered that he promised to actually follow the law and not threaten innocent civilians, at least until proven guilty. Then Ethan pushed Tazka into the pit. Eventually the whole party went down into the pit. Ferwen did her as of yet unexplained to the party, power of talking to doors and learned of the potential for secrets beyond. The party then entered the door and found themselves in a long hallway with two dwarf statues. Leaving the rest of the town to deal with that sinkhole and civilians in danger nonsense, there was a dungeon to explore!!
