    <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right fa-2x"></i> A week after our heroes' excursion against bandits and jaunt into a tomb they find themselves ready and willing to venture forth.
    Ready to show bad guys the business end of a spell or two and prove that those archery classes in summer camp aren't going to waste.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Having made somewhat of a name for themselves from righting wrongs and helping out around town the propietor of the <i>Swinging Sword Inn</i>,
    one <b>Kaylessa Irkell</b> enlisted the heroes for aid. Yet another rumor sprung up, this time of trouble around Lance rock. Children apparently
    were speaking of a plague nearby and to Kaylessa, this must be the source of all the town's woes. Receiving promise of payment (and chicken)
    our team decided to forgo interviewing the children who had been near Lance rock and actually knew what might be going on and headed out
    directly to the cave to investigate.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> After searching the rather odd rock and determining that it was a very old rock and different from other rocks, the heroes found a nearby
    ravine (and a very <i>beautifully</i> designed sign) that led to a cave and the smell of death. Onward, they went into the cave. Inside they found a body,
    which they decided to investigate. The body found this quite rude and just a disagreeable situation in general so it decided to attack the party.
    Our heroes, soon after, figured that zombies are just a tad tougher to take down than anticipated. The druid, <b>Ferwen</b>, also turned into a <a href="/monsters.html#brownbear">bear</a>,
    unnoticed by everyone else but no one really wanted to question the thousand pound ball of teeth, claws and fur that appeared to be more efficient at
    killing the undead than the rest of them.
    <br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> As <b>Fat Altrin</b> nimbly stealthed some swords away from a room of corpses, the heroes enjoyed a small undead circus show with a terrible after party and
    sprung a trap causing rocks to fall before meeting the master of this necromantic cave, <b>Oreioth</b>, who promptly ran away. After more combat with the
    undead in various forms and taking turns riding the bear into combat to look utterly bad ass they pursued Oreioth to his chambers only to find a
    room with a glowing orb sitting on a pedestal with a strange symbol of an eye made of multiple colours glowing from in the orb. Then Oreioth struck,
    but quickly finding himself very outnumbered, tried to run away again. Ferwen didn't like his plan very much and killed him by replacing some of his
    vertebrae with her <i>claws</i>. This was seen overall as an improvement. Victory was had and <b>Marko</b> got himself a bright orb friend while everyone went
    back to town with news that Lance rock was plague free and safe. It was time to enjoy some chicken.
